"""Compute queue with commit cursor.

The invariant from LIVELEARN §3.4:

  Any inference request that arrives *after* the server returned a commit_token
  for a training request must see that training reflected in the model.

Implementation: monotonic integer cursor, single writer (the training worker),
readers block on `wait_for(token)` until the worker's completed-cursor passes
their token. This is a semaphore, not a best-effort signal, and the test in
tests/test_queue_cursor.py is written to fail under reordering.
