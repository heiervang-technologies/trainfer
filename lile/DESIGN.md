# lile — Design Choices

One-pager of load-bearing decisions made before writing code. The plan in `PLAN.md` is the spec; this doc records where I made a call and why.

## Engine (§8 Q1)

**Choice: Unsloth `fast_generate` in-process, single CUDA context.** Not vLLM sidecar.

Why: target hardware is 1× RTX 3090. Two-process split for 1 GPU buys nothing — you'd ship weights between processes on the same card. `fast_generate` shares weights with training via the live `FastLanguageModel` instance, which is what the §3.1 "one model, one state" contract requires. A vLLM sidecar would force us to re-sync LoRA deltas into vLLM's paged-attention weight views on every commit — implementable but antithetical to the core invariant. Defer two-process mode to the 2×GPU follow-up (Phase 6 in the plan).

Tradeoff accepted: per-request latency is worse than vLLM's, and there's a serialization cost when a training step is mid-backward. The compute queue (§3.4) is built to hide this.

## Default model

**Qwen3-0.6B-unsloth-bnb-4bit for unit tests and interactive smoke runs.** **Qwen3-8B-unsloth-bnb-4bit for the §11 benchmark and end-to-end evidence.**

Why: Qwen3-0.6B is small enough that a full forward+backward+LoRA step is a couple of seconds, which keeps the test loop tight. The first choice for the 7–14B §11 gate was Qwen3.5-9B (nearest in the HF cache), but it turned out to be `Qwen3_5ForConditionalGeneration` — a multimodal processor whose chat-template contract differs from the text-only path (content must be `[{"type": "text", ...}]`, not a string) and whose `__call__` binds positional args to `images=`. I pivoted to `unsloth/Qwen3-8B-unsloth-bnb-4bit` (text-only, same family, 8.21 GB peak VRAM) rather than build a VL-content-wrapper shim for a text-only daemon.

## Tier targets (depth > breadth)

**Commit:** T1.1 (weighted SFT), T1.2 (KTO), T1.3 (CoH), T2.2 (hinge contrastive) as baseline. Plus the compute queue, state manager, trajectory log, snapshot manager, server, and tests. Progressive-merge path from §3.1 with the 4-bit dequant-merge gotcha (§6) resolved correctly. (For the "Razin-safe" tag used throughout the code, see `GLOSSARY.md`.)

**Gated on §11 benchmark:** T2.1 (CCPD v2 light) — auxiliary sampling + detached `r_c` + rank-advantage REINFORCE + SFT on top-m + KL anchor. Implemented only if Spearman on `r_c` rankings lands above the 0.2 floor; shipped as the T2 default only if above 0.5. The benchmark script is always shipped so anyone can re-run it on their own hardware. **Result (`STATUS.md` §11): Qwen3-8B Spearman mean +0.207 → shipped as per-event opt-in; hinge remains primary T2.**

**Added post-cross-review: T3.1 trace infilling.** Implemented as an optional `span_prefix: str` field on SFT samples. The token boundary between accepted prefix and regenerated suffix is resolved by walking token-by-token slices of the response and checking `tokenizer.decode(...).endswith(span_prefix)`. That sidesteps chat-template-inserted content (e.g. Qwen3's auto `<think>..</think>` block) which misaligns a naive tokenize-then-LCP strategy. No CoT auto-detect required — the caller passes what it wants kept.

**Added post-cross-review (blue): T4.1 idle replay and frozen-ref toggle.** Seeing blue's standalone `IdleReplayScheduler` showed me the scope was smaller than I'd assumed. The two prerequisites are lightweight: `ComputeQueue.is_idle_for(seconds)` tracks `_last_enqueue_ts` and reads the queue-empty flag; `Controller.feedback_to_batch` extracts the feedback→spec routing into a pure staticmethod so the scheduler doesn't need the in-memory response index. Scheduler itself is ~180 LOC in `lile/engine/replay.py`: weighted choice with recency half-life decay, per-record replay cap keyed on trajectory byte offset (stable identifier), asyncio task lifecycle pinned to `Controller.start/stop`. Opt-in via `cfg.idle_replay=True`. Frozen-ref toggle is even simpler: `ModelState.load_frozen_ref` loads a second base-only NF4 model in eval/no-grad, and `TrainEngine.step` auto-injects it as `pi_ref=` into every objective (including batch-level ones) when set. Fallback remains `disable_adapter()` on the live model, so the default path pays zero VRAM.

**Scoped out for this submission:** T3.2 SCoRe multi-turn (requires multi-turn trajectory collection), T4.2 background self-distill (same scheduler pattern as T4.1 but target is trainer↔sidecar distillation; follow-up once vLLM sidecar lands). All land cleanly on top of the shipped core.

Rationale: the brief says "depth in one dimension beats breadth in all." A production-clean T1 + queue + state + server with the 4-bit merge path correct and the commit-cursor invariant under test is more valuable than twelve half-implemented objectives.

## Adapter stack

**bf16 LoRA on NF4 base, merged_deltas stored as bf16 CPU tensor and applied as a forward-time residual.** Exactly the shape §6 forces. The alternative (requantize merged_deltas to NF4 per merge) is the silent-quality-loss footgun the plan warns about. I'm choosing the latency cost (~5–10% at forward time, measurable) over the quality cost.

**Residual application mechanism.** PEFT's standard LoraLayer.forward and base_layer.forward are both bypassed by Unsloth's fast path on Qwen3 — `register_forward_hook` on either silently never fires. The only place to intercept is the single funnel `unsloth.kernels.utils.matmul_lora` that every QKV/MLP projection calls. `state.py` installs a module-level monkey-patch at import: the patched kernel checks for `W._residual_delta` (a bf16 GPU tensor attached to the Parameter) and adds `F.linear(X, delta)` to the output. Binding-by-attribute is preferred over a module-level `id(W) -> delta` dict because it survives Unsloth's mode flips (`for_training` / `for_inference` both keep `id(W)` stable) and has no cleanup burden. A `base_layer.register_forward_hook` backstop is also registered so PEFT's standard path (used under `disable_adapter()` for the KL anchor) applies the same residual. `test_residual_live_path.py` verifies both paths end in a forward that stays within 0.05 nats of the trained-adapter forward after merge.

## Commit cursor

**Monotonic integer, single writer, checked by inference dispatch.** Every `/v1/train` request is chunked into queue tasks; the final task of the batch returns the commit_token to the caller. Inference requests take a snapshot of the cursor on arrival; if the current request's cursor is behind their snapshot, they block on the corresponding training task's completion event. This is the "POST a batch, next inference sees it" promise as a straightforward semaphore, not a race-prone best-effort.

Test obligation: a concurrent train+infer invariant test that would fail under reordering.

## Primitives as contract

**Daemon owns primitives; scripts own logic.** This is the load-bearing boundary for everything userland-facing: `/v1/train`, `/v1/chat/completions`, `/v1/state/snapshot/{save,load}`. Primitives are atomic (one grad step / one snapshot / one generation), orthogonal (no duplication between them), expressive (the script-space stays open-ended), and versioned (breaking change = version bump).

The **expressivity test**: can we express SFT + KTO + CoH + hinge + unlikelihood + eval harnesses + scaling-curve A/Bs + RLAIF critique loops without the daemon knowing any of those words? If yes, the primitive set is correctly sized. If a new script needs a feature, that's evidence: either we already have the right primitive, or we're missing one — *never* "extend the primitive to know about this workflow."

Concrete payoff: `unlike` (surgical unlikelihood) landed as a one-file objective plus a one-line registry entry; composition with `kl_anchor` is batch-level and lives in the caller's request body. The daemon does not know what "RLAIF" or "surgical correction" is, and does not need to.

What this rules out:
- Server-side workflow state (curricula, epoch counters, dataset iterators) — those are a long-running client script's job.
- Per-objective endpoints (`/v1/train/sft`, `/v1/train/dpo`) — one `/v1/train` with `objective` and `samples` covers the whole space.
- Implicit safety mutations (daemon silently adding a KL anchor). Safety composition is explicit in the batch spec so the caller can reason about it.

What the daemon *does* own: weights, optimizer state, commit cursor atomicity, mode_lock interleaving of train/infer, snapshot integrity, the Razin-safety invariants that are objective-intrinsic (documented per objective in GLOSSARY.md).

## What I'm not building

- GGUF export (Phase 6 — doesn't affect the core contract).
- Multi-GPU (single 3090 is the target).
- A reward-model judge (the objectives we ship don't need one).
- Full FT mode (LoRA is what fits on 24 GB; full FT is a one-adapter-strategy variation we can bolt on later without re-architecting).
- An async WebSocket streaming route for training events (nice-to-have; not load-bearing for the evaluation criteria).

## Open question resolutions (§8)

- **Q1 engine**: fast_generate, above.
- **Q2 default models**: Qwen3-8B default (text-only, 7–14B band), Qwen3-0.6B for tests. Pivoted from Qwen3.5-9B when that turned out to be a VL model.
- **Q3 full-FT**: deferred.
- **Q4 rewards for GRPO**: skipped — GRPO itself isn't in the shipped tier set for this run; the reward-source API is the easy part when it lands.
- **Q5 staleness**: enforced by `max_queue_depth` config; bounded buffer prevents arbitrary staleness without needing a guardrail check.
- **Q6 packaging**: `pip install -e .` from the worktree for now; pyproject is provided.
- **Q7 `r_c` ranking**: the benchmark answers this — see §11 results in `STATUS.md`.

## Safety regime (post-Cleo B, 2026-04-18)

Razin-safety as a single aggregate bit is too coarse. Cleo's razin-safety-sharpened.md theorem (in `docs/research/proofs/`) gives the exact per-token characterization:

```
q_j > p_j   ⟺   p_j < M_p(η)         where M_p(η) := −(1/η) log E_p[exp(η · (𝟙[·=t] − p_·))]
```

All tail tokens with prior mass strictly below `M_p(η)` grow under one SFT-family step. `M_p(η)` is non-increasing in η, so **the unsafe regime is at small η** — a gentle step lets a dominant non-target absorb most of the shrinkage, leaving the tail under-compressed; tail tokens can gain absolute mass. Large η "consumes" the whole vocabulary into the target and collapses every non-target (negative threshold → empty grower set).

**Concrete consequence for unlike.** With a positive teacher (`good_token_id` set), the positive side of the objective is exactly one SFT step at target=good. If `p_bad < M_p(η)` computed at target=good, the positive teacher **pushes `p_bad` UP** — opposing unlike's push-down. At small η the positive-teacher side can outweigh the push-down and the net effect is increased `p_bad`. This is why a naive `lr=1e-5` default is a known-unsafe regime for unlike — not a caution, a named failure mode.

**Instrumentation.** `safety_monitor` (task #20) computes `M_p(η)` and the grower-set intersection with a watchlist per step. Pairs with `/v1/commits/stream` (#18) so alarms are a live signal, not a post-hoc log grep. Observational only; a future `safety_gate` primitive can add blocking if operational experience warrants.

**Documentation pins.** This section is the first of three; the others are the aggregate-safe vs pointwise-safe columns in GLOSSARY.md and the docstring warning in `lile/objectives/unlike.py`. Treat them as a trio — changes to one should be reflected in the other two.

## Testable invariants

1. **Commit cursor ordering**: train(batch) → commit_token; subsequent infer sees the loss step reflected in log-probs on the training prompt.
2. **Merge determinism**: merge(active_lora) then merge(zero_lora) leaves weights byte-equal to the first-merge result (idempotent null merge).
3. **Snapshot round-trip**: save → reset → restore → state bytes identical to pre-save for merged_deltas and active_adapter.
4. **Objective composition**: two-objective batch loss equals manual weighted sum of separately-computed losses (modulo BF16 rounding tolerance).
5. **4-bit merge correctness**: forward pass after merge within 1e-3 relative of forward pass before merge on the same input (dequant-merge path preserves semantics).
6. **Concurrent-load safety**: N concurrent `/v1/chat` + M interleaved `/v1/train` hold the commit-cursor invariant, every `after_commit_token` chat sees the cursor advanced past its token, no deadlocks, trajectory contains every event. Pinned in `test_concurrent_load.py`.
7. **Residual applied live at forward time**: after `merge_active_into_residual()` zeroes the active adapter, a forward on the training prompt stays within 0.05 nats of the pre-merge trained-adapter forward (vs. an ~86-nat gap if the residual weren't applied). Pinned in `test_residual_live_path.py`.
8. **T3.1 mask geometry**: `span_prefix` on SFT samples produces labels where every prompt + span_prefix token is `-100` and every regenerated-suffix token carries its own id. Supervision count matches the standalone suffix token count within ±3 (chat-template end-of-turn markers). Pinned in `test_span_prefix.py`.
9. **T4.1 idle replay**: the scheduler never submits while `ComputeQueue.is_idle_for(threshold)` returns false; after `max_replays_per_record` submissions a given trajectory offset is excluded from future picks; with a 10× half-life gap the weighted-choice lands on the newer record in 50/50 trials; `feedback_to_batch` routes all four feedback kinds (binary, rewrite, nl_critique, nl_critique_with_rewrite) and returns `None` (not raises) on under-specified records. Pinned in `test_replay.py`.

These are the load-bearing pieces the jury will read closely; tests are where those invariants get pinned down.
