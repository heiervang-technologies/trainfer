"""Jurigged-backed hot reload for the lile daemon.

When enabled, ``jurigged.watch(pattern)`` patches live function code objects
in place on file save. Every caller — including references already captured
in the ``OBJECTIVES`` registry, in closures, or in already-bound methods —
gets the new code without a reimport. The model, optimizer, residual, and
trajectory state stay warm.

Limitations (jurigged cannot patch):
- New module files (requires an import somewhere)
- New top-level names imported via ``from X import Y`` elsewhere
- Class hierarchy changes (new base, new abstract method, MRO shift)
- Module-level side-effectful code (e.g. mutations to the OBJECTIVES dict literal)
- Metaclass / dataclass / decorator shape changes
- **FastAPI route handlers defined as closures inside ``create_app()``** — the
  decorator captures the closure's code object at registration time, so edits
  to the route body don't reach the running app. Edit the function those
  closures *call* (controller methods, objective functions) instead; those
  are module-scoped and hot-reload fine.

For those cases, the process must bounce. ``autosave_on_exit`` + ``autoload_on_boot``
make that bounce lossless: weights, optimizer state, residual, and trajectory
offset are restored byte-exact from the ``_autosave`` snapshot on next boot.

Enable via ``cfg.dev_autoreload=True`` or ``LILE_DEV_AUTORELOAD=1``.
