"""pytest conftest for the lile test suite.

Most of this suite imports ``torch`` / ``unsloth`` (directly or through
``lile.controller`` / ``lile.state``) at module scope. On a CI runner
without those heavy deps we still want the ``eval`` harness slice plus
the few stdlib-only slices to collect cleanly, so when torch is missing
we fall back to a whitelist of files known to import without it.

The ``eval`` bucket only needs stdlib + pytest — ``lile.teach.eval`` is
urllib-based and has no torch dependency.

Self-validation
---------------

When torch is absent we also validate that the ``_TORCHLESS_OK`` whitelist
actually matches what's collectible on this runner. A file that declares
``pytestmark = pytest.mark.cpu_only`` but is missing from the whitelist
*and* imports cleanly without torch would silently fail to collect in the
cpu_only CI bucket — exactly the regression PR #36 shipped. The check
raises at conftest load so the miss is loud, not a silent skip.
