    # --- per-objective optimizer instances ---------------------------------
    # When true, ``TrainEngine`` keeps a separate ``torch.optim.AdamW``

    # independently. PyTorch keys ``optimizer.state[param]`` by tensor id,

    # param_groups — shares ``m``/``v``; only LR would isolate. Multiple

    # the LoRA param memory per instance (≈400MB-1.6GB for LoRA r=64 on 7B+
    # depending on target_modules), times N objectives. Turn on only when
    # mixing objectives with substantially different grad magnitudes.
    #
    # Deliberately plain ``torch.optim.AdamW`` (not ``bnb.AdamW8bit``):
    # bitsandbytes' ``GlobalOptimManager`` is a process-wide singleton that

    # --- dev-mode hot reload + crash-safe model state ---------------------

    # bodies across ``trainfer/**/*.py`` are patched live when you save a file, so
    # most edits apply to the running daemon without restart — model,
    # optimizer, residual, trajectory all stay warm. Body-level only:
    # structural edits (new file, new import, class hierarchy, registry dict
    # mutation) still require a process bounce. (2) For that bounce — or any
    # crash / reboot — ``autosave_on_exit`` writes a byte-exact snapshot
    # during graceful shutdown, and ``autoload_on_boot`` restores it on next
    # startup. The "_autosave" slot is the reserved name; user snapshots live
    # beside it unaffected. See ``trainfer/dev/autoreload.py`` and

    # call budget are sized. ``rlvr_weights`` is the linear-combination
